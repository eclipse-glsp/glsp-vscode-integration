# Eclipse GLSP VSCode Integration

This package contains the glue code for integrating [GLSP](https://www.eclipse.org/glsp/)
diagrams in VS Code. This library enables the implementation of GLSP Diagram editors
for VS Code base on the [Custom Editor API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/custom-editors).

## Where to find the sources?

In addition to this repository, the related source code can be found here:

-   https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-server
-   https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client

## Getting started

This section will show you how to get your first GLPS extension up and running using
the _GLSP VSCode Integration_.

### Example Extension

You can find a complete example extension that uses this package
[here](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-vscode-integration/tree/master/example/workflow).
It makes heavy use of default implementations like the default GLSP server, the
default GLSP client and the default GLSP Sprotty client.

### Example Code

There are a few steps that are absolutely necessary for the GLSP VSCode Integration
to work. They are outlined in this section.

#### Extension

First you need to set up your extension starter code. This is done by setting the
`"main"` field of your `package.json` to the entry point of your extension and exporting
an `activate()` function from that file. For more information on how to set up your
VSCode extension please visit https://code.visualstudio.com/api.

<details><summary>Code Example</summary>

```typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

export async function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext): Promise<void> {
    // Your extension code here.
}
```

</details>

#### Server

Next we will start a GLSP server from within the activate function. If you have
already have the server running through some other process you can skip this step.

If you are using the default GLSP server implementation provided at https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-server,
you can use the `GlspServerLauncher` [quickstart component](#Quickstart-Components)
to start the server with very little code:

<details><summary>Code Example</summary>

```typescript
import { GlspServerLauncher } from '@eclipse-glsp/vscode-integration/lib/quickstart-components';

export async function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext): Promise<void> {
    const serverProcess = new GlspServerLauncher({
        jarPath: '/your/path/to/server.jar',
        serverPort: 5007
    });
    context.subscriptions.push(serverProcess);
    await serverProcess.start();
}
```

</details>

#### Server Interface and GLSP VSCode Connector

A connector class is needed to provide an interface for the _GLSP VSCode integration_
to communicate with the server. If you are using the default GLSP server which communicates
over JSON-RPC, you can make use of the `SocketGlspVscodeServer` [quickstart component](#Quickstart-Components)
to implement the needed interface with very little boilerplate code.

If we have a server component providing the needed interface we can create an instance
of the `GlspVscodeConnector` and pass the server component. The `GlspVscodeConnector`
lies at the core of this package and provides all the needed functionality.

<details><summary>Code Example</summary>

```typescript
import { GlspVscodeConnector } from '@eclipse-glsp/vscode-integration';
import { SocketGlspVscodeServer } from '@eclipse-glsp/vscode-integration/lib/quickstart-components';

export async function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext): Promise<void> {
    // (Server startup code from above here...)

    const workflowServer = new SocketGlspVscodeServer({
        clientId: 'some.client.id',
        clientName: 'SomeClientName',
        serverPort: 5007
    });

    const glspVscodeConnector = new GlspVscodeConnector({ server: workflowServer });

    context.subscriptions.push(workflowServer, glspVscodeConnector);
}
```

</details>

#### Custom Editor Provider

In order to have a custom editor in VSCode a component implementing the `vscode.CustomEditorProvider`
needs to be registered from within the extension (more information on custom editors
[here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/custom-editors)).

The GLSP VSCode integration package gives you free reign over how you implement
your `CustomEditorProvider`, however a few function calls at certain places are
needed for the integration to work properly:

-   The `onDidChangeCustomDocument` of your `CustomEditorProvider` should always fire
    at least when `GlspVscodeConnector.onDidChangeCustomDocument` fires.
-   `GlspVscodeConnector.saveDocument(document)` should be called when `CustomEditorProvider.saveCustomDocument`
    is called.
-   `GlspVscodeConnector.saveDocument(document, destination)` should be called when
    `CustomEditorProvider.saveCustomDocumentAs` is called.
-   `GlspVscodeConnector.revertDocument()` should be called when `CustomEditorProvider.revertCustomDocument`
    is called.

You can use the `GlspEditorProvider` [quickstart component](#Quickstart-Components)
to set up such an editor provider without much boilerplate code.

If you chose to create a `CustomEditorProvider` yourself, the `resolveCustomEditor`
function of the `CustomEditorProvider` act as an excellent place to register your
GLSP clients. You can do this with the `GlspVscodeConnector.registerClient(client)`
function. You are free to choose on how your clients implement the needed interface,
however if you need inspiration on how to do it with the default GLSP components,
you can take a look at the example
[here](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-vscode-integration/tree/master/example/workflow).

<details><summary>Code Example</summary>

```typescript
import MyCustomEditorProvider from './my-custom-editor-provider.ts';

export async function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext): Promise<void> {
    // (Server startup code from above here...)
    // (GlspVscodeConnector code from above here...)

    const customEditorProvider = vscode.window.registerCustomEditorProvider(
        'your.custom.editor',
        new MyCustomEditorProvider(glspVscodeConnector),
        {
            webviewOptions: { retainContextWhenHidden: true },
            supportsMultipleEditorsPerDocument: false
        }
    );

    context.subscriptions.push(customEditorProvider);
}
```

```typescript
// my-custom-editor-provider.ts
export default class WorkflowEditorProvider implements vscode.CustomEditorProvider {
    onDidChangeCustomDocument: vscode.Event<vscode.CustomDocumentContentChangeEvent<vscode.CustomDocument>>;

    constructor(private readonly glspVscodeConnector: GlspVscodeConnector) {
        this.onDidChangeCustomDocument = glspVscodeConnector.onDidChangeCustomDocument; // necessary
    }

    // (Any other methods needed for the vscode.CustomEditorProvider interface here.)

    saveCustomDocument(document: vscode.CustomDocument, cancellation: vscode.CancellationToken): Thenable<void> {
        return this.glspVscodeConnector.saveDocument(document); // necessary
    }

    saveCustomDocumentAs(document: vscode.CustomDocument, destination: vscode.Uri, cancellation: vscode.CancellationToken): Thenable<void> {
        return this.glspVscodeConnector.saveDocument(document, destination); // necessary
    }

    revertCustomDocument(document: vscode.CustomDocument, cancellation: vscode.CancellationToken): Thenable<void> {
        return this.glspVscodeConnector.revertDocument(document, 'your.diagram.type'); // necessary
    }

    resolveCustomEditor(
        document: vscode.CustomDocument,
        webviewPanel: vscode.WebviewPanel,
        token: vscode.CancellationToken
    ): void | Thenable<void> {
        const onSendToClientEmitter = new vscode.EventEmitter<unknown>();
        const onClientMessage = new vscode.EventEmitter<unknown>();

        // (Your code to send event content to webview here using onSendToClientEmitter.)
        // (Your code to emit messages from client with onClientSendEmitter.)

        this.glspVscodeConnector.registerClient({
            clientId: 'your.glsp.client.id.here', // Should be different each time resolve custom Editor is called - must be equal to the ids the client will send in its messages
            document: document,
            webviewPanel: webviewPanel,
            onClientMessage: onClientSendEmitter.event,
            onSendToClientEmitter: onSendToClientEmitter
        });

        webviewPanel.webview.html = `(Your webview HTML here)`;
    }
}
```

</details>

#### Final touches

All that's left to do is a final call to start the server and the extension
should be up and running.

<details><summary>Code Example</summary>

```typescript
export async function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext): Promise<void> {
    // (Server startup code from above here...)
    // (GlspVscodeConnector code from above here...)
    // (CustomEditorProvider code from above here...)

    workflowServer.start();
}
```

</details>

## API

This package exports a number of members, the most important one being the `GlspVscodeConnector`-Class.

### GlspVscodeConnector

This is the core of the VSCode integration and provides various functionality. It
primarily intercepts certain GLSP Actions sent from the clients or server to trigger
VSCode specific contributions. This currently includes:

-   File dirty state
-   File "Save" and "Save as..."
-   File reverting
-   Diagnostics or "markers" and "validations"
-   External target navigation
-   Exporting as SVG (with dialog window)
-   Providing element selection context to extensions

#### Options

The `GlspVscodeConnector` takes one constructor argument - an object containing its configuration.

```typescript
export interface GlspVscodeConnectorOptions {
    /**
     * The GLSP server (or its wrapper) that the VSCode integration should use.
     */
    server: GlspVscodeServer;

    /**
     * Wether the GLSP-VSCode integration should log various events. This is useful
     * if you want to find out what events the VSCode integration is receiving from
     * and sending to the server and clients.
     *
     * Defaults to `false`.
     */

     *
     * The returned value from this function is the message that will be propagated
     * to the server. It can be modified to anything. Returning `undefined` will
     * cancel the propagation.

     * integration did not modify the message, this parameter will be identical to
     * `originalMessage`.
     * @param messageChanged This parameter will indicate wether the VSCode integration
     * modified the incoming message. In other words: Whether `originalMessage`
     * and `processedMessage` are different.
     * @returns A message that will be propagated to the server. If the message
     * is `undefined` the propagation will be cancelled.
     */
    onBeforePropagateMessageToServer?(originalMessage: unknown, processedMessage: unknown, messageChanged: boolean): unknown | undefined;

    /**

     */
    readonly onServerMessage: vscode.Event<unknown>;
}
```

### GlspVscodeClient

```typescript
/**
 * Any clients registered on the GLSP VSCode integration need to implement this
 * interface.
 */
export interface GlspVscodeClient<D extends vscode.CustomDocument = vscode.CustomDocument> {
    /**
     * A unique identifier for the client/panel with which the client will be registered

     */
    readonly onClientMessage: vscode.Event<unknown>;
}
```

### Quickstart Components

This package also exposes components which can be taken advantage of if you are using the default GLSP components.

They can be imported using

```ts
import * as QuickstartComponents from '@eclipse-glsp/vscode-integration/lib/quickstart-components';
```

#### GlspServerLauncher

A small class used to start a default implementation GLSP server.

```ts
interface GlspServerLauncher extends vscode.Disposable {
    constructor(options: JavaSocketServerLauncherOptions);

    /**
     * Starts up the server.
     */
    start(): Promise<void>;

    /**
     * Stops the server.
     */
    stop(): void;
}

interface JavaSocketServerLauncherOptions {
    /** Path to the location of the jar file that should be launched as process */
    readonly jarPath: string;
    /** Port on which the server should listen for new client connections */
    readonly serverPort: number;
    /** Set to `true` if server stdout and stderr should be printed in extension host console. Default: `false` */
    readonly logging?: boolean;
    /** Additional arguments that should be passed when starting the server process. */
    readonly additionalArgs?: string[];
}
```

#### SocketGlspVscodeServer

A can component that provides the right interface for the GLSP VSCode integration
to be used as server and which can connect to a default implementation GLSP server.

```ts
interface SocketGlspVscodeServerOptions {
    /** Port of the running server. */
    readonly serverPort: number;
    /** Client ID to register the jsonRPC client with on the server. */
    readonly clientId: string;
    /** Name to register the client with on the server. */
    readonly clientName: string;
}

interface SocketGlspVscodeServer extends GlspVscodeServer, vscode.Disposable {
    constructor(private readonly options: SocketGlspVscodeServerOptions);

    /**
     * Starts up the JSON-RPC client and connects it to a running server.
     */
    start(): Promise<void>;

    /**
     * Stops the client. It cannot be restarted.
     */
    stop(): Promise<void>;
}
```

#### GlspEditorProvider

An extensible base class to create a CustomEditorProvider that takes care of diagram
initialization and custom document events.

Webview setup needs to be implemented.

```ts
export abstract class GlspEditorProvider implements vscode.CustomEditorProvider {
    /**
     * The diagram type identifier the diagram server is responsible for.
     */
    abstract diagramType: string;

    constructor(protected readonly glspVscodeConnector: GlspVscodeConnector);

    /**
     * Used to set up the webview within the webview panel.
     */
    abstract setUpWebview(
        document: vscode.CustomDocument,
        webviewPanel: vscode.WebviewPanel,
        token: vscode.CancellationToken,
        clientId: string
    ): void;
}
```
